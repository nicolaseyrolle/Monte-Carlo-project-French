# Monte-Carlo_project_-French-


Here you can find a project supervised by Julien STOEHR ( Master of conference at Paris-Dauphine University) about Monte-Carlo Methods.

In this repository there is the R-Markdown version of the project in french.

The aim was to confront the theoritical aspect of the methods with the practical one. It required us to make algorithms in R.
